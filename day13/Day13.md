## What I Learned Today

* **Training Multiple Models**

  * Importance of benchmarking different algorithms
  * Understanding bias–variance tradeoff

* **Hyperparameter Tuning**

  * Effect of hyperparameters on model performance
  * Improving generalization using tuning strategies

* **Feature Importance**

  * Identifying impactful features
  * Removing irrelevant or low-importance features

* **Spark ML Pipelines**

  * Building end-to-end ML workflows
  * Chaining preprocessing and model stages
  * Ensuring reproducibility and scalability

## Tasks I Completed

### 1. Trained Multiple Models

* Trained **three different ML models** (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting)
* Used the same dataset and evaluation strategy for fair comparison

### 2. Compared Metrics Using MLflow

* Logged parameters and metrics for each model
* Compared performance (MSE, RMSE, R², etc.) across runs
* Identified strengths and weaknesses of each model

### 3. Built a Spark ML Pipeline

* Created a pipeline including:

  * Feature transformation
  * Feature assembly
  * Model training
  * Ensured clean and modular ML workflow

### 4. Selected the Best Model

* Chose the best-performing model based on metrics
* Validated model stability and consistency
* Prepared model for next-stage optimization or deployment
