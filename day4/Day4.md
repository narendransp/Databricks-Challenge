# Day 4 Completed – Databricks 14 Days AI Challenge  
**Sponsored by Databricks**

Successfully completed **Day 4** of the Databricks AI Challenge, where I explored **Delta Lake** and learned how it brings reliability, consistency, and scalability to modern data lake architectures.

## What I Learned Today

### Delta Lake
- Introduction to Delta Lake as a storage layer on top of data lakes
- How Delta Lake improves reliability for big data workloads

### ACID Transactions
- Atomic, Consistent, Isolated, and Durable transactions
- Safe handling of concurrent reads and writes

### Schema Enforcement
- Enforcing schema at write time
- Preventing invalid or unexpected data from entering the data lake

### Delta vs Parquet
- Limitations of plain Parquet files
- Advantages of Delta Lake for production data pipelines

---

## Tasks I Completed
- Converted CSV data into Delta format  
- Created Delta tables using **SQL** and **PySpark**  
- Tested schema enforcement with invalid data inserts  
- Handled duplicate inserts safely using Delta features  

---

## Key Takeaways
- Delta Lake adds database-like reliability to data lakes  
- ACID transactions are critical for data consistency  
- Schema enforcement improves long-term data quality  
- Delta tables are better suited for real-world data engineering pipelines
